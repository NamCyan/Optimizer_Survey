# Optimizer Survey

## Abstract
This work makes a survey about optimization algorithms in Deep learning based on Gradient descent. We conduct various tasks such as Image classification, Text classification and Image generation using 9 optimization algorithms. The results show that The Adam-based methods are often the leading methods of learning effectiveness (QHAdam, AdamW, Demon Adam).
